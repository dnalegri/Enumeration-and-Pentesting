# Network-Scanning-and-Ethical-Pentesting

## Objective

The network enumeration and ethical pentesting project followed the five phases of pentesting: reconnaissance, scanning, vulnerability assessment, exploitation, and reporting. It allowed me to identify security vulnerabilities within a system and then exploit them. 
It is important to note that in a real-world pentest, vulnerabilities will vary from system to system and the exploits available. This project is focused on tools such as Nmap and Metasploit and how to use them effectively.

### Skills Learned

- Understanding of network scanning.
- Vulnerability and risk assessment.
- Ability to identify active ports, systems, and applications.
- Knowledge and understanding of Linux OS.
- Network enumeration and learning how to connect to FTP, SMB, SSH, etc.

### Tools Used

- VMware Workstations (Parrot OS, Ubuntu, Kali Linux).
- Nmap.
- Metasploit.

## Steps

*Ref 1: Log in to our victim machine and use "ifconfig" to get the IP*

*Ref 2: Using the pentest machine, ping the IP of the victim machine to establish it's connected*

*Ref 3: Using Nmap, scan the victim machine to see open ports. Use -sV for service/version info*

*Ref 4: Perform research on exploits. For this test, I used the SMB port. As we can see, there's a known exploit for Samba for username map script. We can investigate this further by clicking on the link.*

*Ref 5: Launch Metasploit on our pentest machine using "msfconsole". The launch is successful if we see the art grid.*

*Ref 6: in the Metasploit console use the search cmd followed by "Samba". Viewing the results, we can see that option 8 displays the exploit we researched previously.*

*Ref 7: Type "use #" in the Metasploit console. As you can see we have not set up the payload. Using "show options" cmd we can see that the Rhost is required to run the exploit.*

*Ref 8: Using the "set" cmd we will set the Rhost to the victim machine IP. Using the "show options" cmd again we can verify that the Rhost is set up correctly.*

*Ref 9: Run the exploit. Verify we are in the victim machine by typing "whoami" in the shell. It responds with "root". We have successfully infiltrated the victim machine.*

*Ref 10: Instead of always running this exploit when we wish to access the victim machine, we will establish persistence and set up a user account.*

*Ref 11: We will log in to the victim machine using SSH. Since it is our first time logging in, it will prompt for a fingerprint. After, we can verify that we have successfully logged in to the victim machine by using the "pwd" cmd.*

*Ref 12: The last step is to create a report documenting our findings including the steps we took to exploit this machine and the remediation required. Our pentest report should include the purpose, an executive summary, scope, reference documents, and the results from the port scan. We can view the severity of the exploit by using nvd.nist.gov and use this in our findings. This concludes the end of the project.*
